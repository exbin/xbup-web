This document is part of the eXtensible Binary Universal Protocol project documentation. Provides a description of the project for the creation of an abstract initial code for initiating communication with a foreign entity completely without any apriori knowledge.

<h2 class="sectionedit2" id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>
The UniCoIniSch project (Universal Communication Inicialization Schema) should serve as a technology for initiating communication and transmission of basic data to define the method of exchange of information. There is no expected knowledge of the second subject on other sides.

<h3 class="sectionedit3" id="motivation">Motivation</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
If you&#039;d like to make contact with alien civilizations, how would you proceed? One option is to use what you can assume that with them in common, which may be for example the logic. Assuming that both parties knows same logic and managed to logically deduced communication pattern, it may be assumed that they should both be able to understand and to establish mutual communication.

<p>
<em>The project might be seen as a particular variant of universal translator used in the series Star Trek <img src="/old/dokuwiki/lib/images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" class="icon" alt=":-)" /></em>
</p>

<p>
This is most likely the most sophisticated use of the XBUP project, which is so far absolutely out of any option. Thus, it is a very long-term goal, far far away.

<h3 class="sectionedit4" id="principles">Principles</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
Assuming that the other party knows a XBUP protocol, it should be possible to define the fundamental postulates of logic and their transformation to the selected language. Using mutual exchange of data in the desired form should then rise in some translation table on both sides, and therefore possibility to initiate the communication.
</p>

<p>
The project foresees precise formal evidence of the correctness of the construction â€¦

<p>
The construction of communication on the following basis is expected:
