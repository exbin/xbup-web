<p>
ProgJazy project aims to create universally usable language for algorithm representation. The main difference of this language to other programming language is, that the source codes are not primary represented in a text form.
</p>

<p>
Project has following web page: <a href="http://progjazy.xbup.org" class="urlextern" title="http://progjazy.xbup.org"  rel="nofollow">http://progjazy.xbup.org</a>.

<h3 class="sectionedit3" id="motivation">Motivation</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
As a part of XBUP protocol, it&#039;s also necessary to declare programming and scripting language, which should allow to represent algorithms for data transformations. Currently used programming languages with textual syntax are not suitable for purposes of the protocol, especially because the depends on used spoken language.
</p>

<p>
The aim of this project is to design the versatile language which can provide also environment for programming regular applications, in the first phase especially applications for text and graphical user interface, as well as using the commonly used paradigms, particularly object and procedural.

<h3 class="sectionedit4" id="principles">Principles</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
The aim is to define a binary syntax and as close as possible to represent the shape of the abstract syntax tree. Text syntax is an optional human interface, which is not distributed and the conversion is performed in an environment of dynamic editing program.
</p>

<p>
Language should directly build on the capabilities of XBUP protocol, especially in relation to the declaration of data structures.
</p>

<p>
This approach of source files representation should provide following advantages:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Selective textual syntax</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Language independent representation</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Better compilation performance</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Lesser size of source files</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Higher level of abstraction</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Better machine processing</div>
</li>
</ul>
