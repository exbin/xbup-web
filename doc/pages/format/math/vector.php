<div class="level2">

<p>
These blocks should allow representation of conventional planar objects such as line, infinite line, circle, ellipse, filled areas of various shapes, and various combinations of other functions. Vectors, considered as a special area of arrays, have their limitation to a one-dimensional and two-dimensional variants.

<div class="level2">

<p>
Vectors in space is an extension of the planar object with additional dimension and with introduction of various new objects such as box, sphere, pyramid and more.
